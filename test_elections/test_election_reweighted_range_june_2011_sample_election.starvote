# ABOUT THIS ELECTION:
#   This election had 45 potential voters, of whom 39 actually voted (denoted V1...V39),
# and 16 candidates (denoted C101..C116).  The election's purpose was to elect 9 winners.
# Roughly speaking, the stakes were equivalent to jobs for few years for the winners.
# The voters each were supposed to rate each candidate on a scale from 0=terrible to 9=great.
# However, evidently some voters left some candidates unscored (X), perhaps due to apathy,
# laziness, or self-perceived ignorance.
#
# Q. Why it is that some voters did not score some candidates?
# A.  Voters were instructed "PLEASE RATE ALL CANDIDATES BELOW unless
# you feel you do not know someone well enough to evaluate him/her. You
# may register a vote of 'no opinion' by leaving a candidate's rating
# blank which will neither help nor hurt someone's score."
#
# While most people in the 45 know each other, there was a possibility
# that some qualified candidates would be disadvantaged by the fact that
# some voters didn't have the opportunity to work closely with them.
# (Some candidates had the advantage of having worked with all voters
# for several years, while other candidates - based on factors beyond
# their control - had less time to work with all voters.)
#
# Q. Is it ok if I reveal that you're a prestigious musical group and the
# vote-scores are presumably largely based on hearing performances by
# the candidates?
# A. Sure, but allow me to correct one misconception here. The primary
# criteria was NOT based on performance ability - there were no playing
# auditions for this vote.
#    The goal of this election was focused on choosing a "leadership team"
# from amongst the 45 players. The 9 members of the leadership team will
# be charged with setting the artistic/administrative direction of the
# organization.
#    Playing ability was likely one factor among many that voters
# considered when evaluating the candidates. Other factors that were
# (hopefully!) considered were leadership ability, organizational
# ability, etc.
#    In addition to the body of work that each candidate has produced over
# the past 1-3 years, all candidates were required to submit a statement
# describing their vision/qualifications for serving on the leadership
# team.  The specific instructions to voters were;
#   "Based on your informed opinion and a close reading of the candidates'
# statements, please rate each candidate's fitness for a spot on the
# 'Leadership Team'."
#    So this election was not just about hiring people (or making their
# jobs more permanent) it has a political aspect as well.
#
# FULL RANKING:
#    I was asked actually to rank the 16 candidates in order so that if some of the 9 winners
# could not serve, they could go further down to list to hire "ALTERNATES."
# The RRV program did so, but there is a CRITICISM of that, pointed out by Aaron Hamlin -- it
# violates the PR (proportional representation) philosophy.   To explain that vis-a-vis
# "Democrats" vs "Republicans," PR assures that Republicans (if a fraction-F minority) will
# win about fraction F of the seats (as opposed to naive voting methods which would yield 100%
# Democrat winners).  RRV does so by continually "reweighting" the votes.  In that situation
# the Dems would win seat #1, but then the voters who rated winner#1 high, would get
# their votes deweighted.  With enough Dem-winners and hence Dem-deweighting, the Republican
# voters would obtain the majority of the weight and be able to elect a Republican winner (but
# then they'd be deweighted).  The weighting formulas are devised to assure PR.  Now
# Aaron Hamlin's point is this.   If among the 9 winners, the guy who drops out is a Republican,
# then that ought to bias things so that the 1st alternate is Republican.  Or ditto
# with "Democrat."  Point is, who should be the first alternate, DEPENDS on which of
# the first 9 winners dropped out -- it isn't just one fixed ordering.  If two of the 9
# drop out, it would depend on them both and could be even more complicated.
#    Fortunately there does not appear to have been a lot of factionalism in this election
# (at least compared to USA politics) so these issues probably do not matter hugely.
#
# RRV VOTING METHOD described here:     http://RangeVoting.org/RRV.html
# It produces an ordering from best to worst, such that the first K candidates in the ordering are
# the "best" K winners in a PR sense (for any & every value of K).
#
# FACTIONS:
# The strategic voters seem a lot different to naive clustering algorithms, e.g.
# {V24, V35} appear to form "one faction," with everybody else in the "other faction."
# That may just indicate that naive clustering algorithms are not a good way to identify
# factions.

# MORE COMMENTS AND OTHER ELECTION METHODS...
# Note the K=0.5 and K=1 RRV processes gave the exact same order, which is
# fortunate because there is some debate about the best value of K --
# but for this election, K made no difference.  The naive and RRV orders
# were the same except for swapping C108,C109 and C103,C110 and then
# further changes from the 9th place onward.
# The 9th placer actually matters since the 9th and last winner
# (since they wanted 9 winners only) changes using RRV versus naive;
# RRV elects C107, naive elects C111.
# Unfortunately due to a bug in the program's handling of "X" votes
# (now fixed) they may have gone with C111.
#
# Jameson Quinn says in this election he prefers K=1 but they returned the same winner set
# so it does not matter.
# I (Warren Smith) don't have any clear preference on K=1/2 versus K=1, there is
# a small discussion of that on   http://RangeVoting.org/RRV.html
# which doesn't really help me decide for your case.
#
# Jameson Quinn informs me meanwhile that he has programmed a voting method of his own
# invention "AT-TV method" and it yielded this ordering and top 9:
#    [C106, C102, C109, C101, C103, C108, C105, C110, C104]
#    7 candidates elected in round 1 (cutoff=9), 1 in round 2 (cutoff=8),
#    and one in round 5 (cutoff=5).
#    Continuing onward to order the remaining 7 candidates, Quinn finds...
#           C112, C107, C116, C114, C115, C113, C111.
#
# Quinn writes:
#   The biggest discrepancy with the RRV results is that C105 is much higher on my list.
# That is apparently because C105 had a strong core of supporters who rated him/her at 9,
# but did not have broad support (relatively low average rating). I suspect that is
# also because my method penalizes the C106 voters much less than RRV, and the voters for
# lower elected candidates (i.e, C108) more. So perhaps my method chooses C105 to
# "balance out" C108. That's just a superficial guess, though.
#    Later: Ted Stern has run a method he calls PR-CTV, and
# Kristofer Munsterhjelm has run several more methods "birational," "range PAV," and "STV"
# (using certain random tie-breaks) and all four of these methods produced the same top 9 as AT-TV.
# KM also ran "QPQ" and "Meek STV" both of which produced these top 9 (not in order):
#     {C102 C103 C104 C105 C106 C107 C109 C110 C116}   note C101 did not win
# while "Schulze STV" produced these top 9 (not in order)
#     {C102 C103 C104 C105 C106 C107 C109 C114 C116}   note C101 did not win.

# Based on this we find that C106 is not only the average-score winner, he/she also is the
# Condorcet (beats all rivals pairwise) winner and the IRV (instant runoff) winner
# (according to Eric Gorr, where note I believe his program regards unranked candidates as
# ranked coequal bottom).  Gorr's program indeed finds that there is an unambiguous
# notion of the top 5 candidates in order:
#    C106 > C102 > C101 > C109 > C103
# where each ">" means "preferred pairwise by a voter majority versus all candidates
# to the right (if unranked candidates regarded as being ranked coequal bottom)" --
# although the 6th-placer is unclear since there is a CONDORCET CYCLE
#     C105 = C108 = C110 > C105.
#        17:17  16:16  16:13
# (6th placer could be C108 or C110...  C105 would be the
# most likely IRV winner with the top 5 removed, "most likely" meaning with random
# tiebreaks.)
#   Note that this order agrees with RRV's election order (regardless of K=0.5 or K=1)
# for these first 5, and RRV also agrees to take two out of three of the members of the Condorcet
# cycle (C108 and C110) as its next two winners.  RRV however does not elect C105,
# presumably because of deweighting.  C105 had a high correlation with C110 and C101, both of
# whom had already been elected, but it seems as though this is not enough to explain why C105 was
# not elected while C104 and C111 or C107 were.  It is not clear to me why RRV does not like C105;
# apparently PAIRwise correlations are not enough to explain it and higher order correlations
# (triples...) would be needed?

# WARNING: The below may be buggy, needs to be recomputed:
#
# One way to assess the impact of the 4 strategic approval-style voters V6 V14 V24 V35 is to re-count the election
# with them removed.  We would then have these
# Average Scores for the 16 candidates:
# C101=7.471
# C102=7.743
# C103=6.794
# C104=5.844
# C105=5.429
# C106=8.000
# C107=5.697
# C108=6.515
# C109=6.912
# C110=6.529
# C111=5.964
# C112=3.829
# C113=4.029
# C114=4.686
# C115=4.029
# C116=5.676
# This would naively induce the following order (top to bottom) for the candidates:
#  C106, C102, C101, C109, C103, C110, C108, C111, C104,  C107, C116, C105, C114, C115, C113, C112
# as opposed to the naive order with the strategic voters left in, which was:
#  C106, C102, C101, C109, C108, C103, C110, C104, C111,  C107, C116, C105, C114, C113, C115, C112
# which note was the same top 9 (indeed the same top 1,2,3,4,7,9,10, and 11).
# So in that naive sense, the strategic voting has zero effect.
# The RRV(K=0.5 and K=1.0) order with the strategists removed was:
#  C106, C102, C101, C109, C103,  C110, C108, C111, C116, C104,  C107, C105, C113, C114, C115,  C112
# which compares with this RRV order with strategists included:
#  C106, C102, C101, C109, C103,  C108, C110, C104, C107, C111,  C116, C105, C113, C114, C115,  C112
# .................................A swap B....AAAAAAAA swap BBBBBBB...........
# Thus in some sense the strategists had little effect, but they were able to change RRV winners #8 & #9.
