# Bug submitted by Adam Masiarek, github issue #7
#
# "No Preference" should be the number of *voters*
# who expressed no preference between any of the candidates
# in what I call a "preference round".  It was actually
# printing the number of individual head-to-head contests
# in the round that had no preference, and there could be
# more than one on a single ballot.
#
# For example, in this sample ballot, "No Preference"
# should be 3, but it was printing 9.
